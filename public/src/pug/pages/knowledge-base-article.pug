                p.lead Here's an example of what an article in your knowledge base will look like.
                p.lead You can use the paragraph element along with other typography elements and text tools to create articles within your knowledge base. This is a great way to display support information to your users.
                p.lead The knowledge base page examples are a great starting point for creating FAQ's, documentation, and more. In this section, we're using the lead paragraph class to make the text a bit larger so it's more legible since it's meant to be read in sentences.
                p.lead.mb-5 You can also use step-by-step examples in this section:
                h4 Step 1: Start the process
                p.lead.mb-4 Here is some example text of a longer version of a first step. This format is great when you need to explain things more, not just using a ordered list.
                h4 Step 2: Continue doing something
                p.lead.mb-4 We're using built-in elements and text utilities to make this list more legible and understandable. This is a great starting point for a step by step guide within your knowledge base article.
                h4 Step 3: Finish the process
                p.lead.mb-5 We've used spacing utilities, text utilities, and other components within this article example. This is just an example layout of a few things you can do within an article page. Thanks for reading!
